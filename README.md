# AI vs Human: NLP Project

This repository contains the **AI vs Human** project, developed as the graduation project for the **Machine Learning for Data Analysis** program under the **Digital Egypt Youth** initiative. The project explores two advanced approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify or differentiate between AI-generated and human-written text.

## Project Overview

With the proliferation of AI models generating human-like text, the ability to distinguish between AI and human writing has become crucial. This project aims to address this challenge using two distinct methodologies:

1. **Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs)**
2. **Transformers**

The repository includes two separate Jupyter Notebooks, each detailing the implementation, training, and evaluation of these approaches.

## Contents

- `BRNNs.ipynb`: Implementation of the AI vs Human classification model using Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks.
- `Transformers.ipynb`: Implementation of the AI vs Human classification model using Transformer-based architectures.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Details the preprocessing pipeline for text data to ensure compatibility with both models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Each notebook walks through the steps of training and evaluating the respective models, with metrics to compare their performance.
- **Visualization**: Includes visual representations of model performance, such as accuracy and loss plots.
- **Code Modularity**: Well-structured code with clear comments for easy understanding and modification.

## Requirements

To replicate the results or experiment with the models, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Key Python Libraries:
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn
